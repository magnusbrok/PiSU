  This package defines an interface for a {@see dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.stack.Stack} of
  {@see java.lang.Integer} values as well as stubs for implementations
  of two versions of a {@see dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.stack.Stack}: one based
  on singly linked lists and one for arrays. These implementations fail the
  test and must be properly implemented by the students of the course as
  task of assignment 1 of the course.<p>
  
  This interface and the implementations will be extended in later tutorials
  of the course.
